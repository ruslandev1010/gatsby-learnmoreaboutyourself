# What is Confidence? – How To Boost

[Confidence](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/counseling-center/top-concerns/what-is-self-confidence.aspx#:~:text=Self%2Dconfidence%20is%20an%20attitude,assertively%2C%20and%20can%20handle%20criticism.) demonstrates your ability and skill.

Your low self-esteem towards others makes you feel full of self-doubt, and makes you submissive to it, feeling confident in others. The feeling of self-confidence in you may depend on the situation. For example, you may feel very confident in some areas, such as scholars, but lack confidence in others, such as relationships.

Having high or low self-confidence is rarely related to your actual abilities, and mostly based on your assumptions. The way you think about yourself is the way it is and these thoughts can be flawed.

Low self-esteem can be overcome by different experiences, such as growing up in an unsatisfactory and critical environment, being separated from your friends or family for the first time, judging yourself too harshly, or fearing failure. People with low self-esteem often have errors in their thinking.

## How to boost your confidence
