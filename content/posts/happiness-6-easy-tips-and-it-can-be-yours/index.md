## Happiness – 6 Easy Tips

### Assumption.

- This can be a real party killer. This is additionally one of the foremost best traps to constitute. we start our journey into “assumption” by what we have a tendency to expertise early in life. You know, the recent principle of action and reaction right? to place it merely, each action we have a tendency to observe or participate in ourselves leads to some style of reaction. This is true for everything in life. We begin to develop a sense of assumption by the results we have witnessed by various actions throughout our lives. Pretty soon we are all assuming the things that will occur due to the action we take. This is not all bad because this also helps in the development of our sense of justice. The trouble with the assumption is it can wrongly cause us to worry about things that have no factual evidence. What a time-waster it is to worry about something you may have or have not done correctly without any evidence to support it. Or, even worse, to assume something about someone else that turns out to be incorrect. Try not to waste time assuming the worst. Breaking that habit will have a very positive effect on your life.

### Happiness - The power of positive thinking.

- This is related to the assumption tip above. Do you believe in luck? Did you know that for the most part luck doesn’t just happen? It’s true. Positive thinking has been proven to actually create in your life what many people would describe as luck. There is nothing you can not accomplish if you suspect in yourself. Put all of your minds into believing you can accomplish what you set out do to and you will begin seeing just how “lucky” you really can become!

### Don’t think in terms of absolutes.

- If you pay all of your time thinking in terms like “never”, “can’t”, “won’t”, “always”, etc. you start to develop negativity. again and again, you'll not be ready to see the forest for the trees as a result of you develop visual impairment in reality. Don’t be a boring fish yourself. You will lose your creativity and your ability to accomplish the things in life that bring you happiness. If you can’t begin to visualize yourself being happy because things just “can’t” happen that way…well…then…you “won’t” ever get there. It’s just that simple.

### Try you're had at…..should I say it?….. Volunteering.

- It almost sounded a little nerdy to be the first time I decided to give it a shot. I mean, don’t I have better things to do than volunteer??? What could giving possibly get me in return. I found out the truth of that one several years back on Christmas Eve. No, it wasn’t concerning family and friends obtaining along and exchanging gifts. I decided one Christmas Eve to volunteer at a local community center to serve free dinner to those less fortunate. Long story short, I discovered a type of happiness that just keeps on giving. The truth is that it feels good to do something for others and that feeling can stay with you for years to come. I challenge you to grant it an attempt to prove the American state wrong.

### Time management

- Another nerdy concept for many but I can tell you that running around in a harried state of mind constantly is not a very happy thing to do. Prioritize things on a daily basis. Decide beforehand how your day will progress. Allow a little time for the unexpected. You will discover quickly that chaos on a daily basis is a true happiness robber if there ever was one. A little organization will add real peace of mind by the end of the day.

### Diet.

- Now I am not going into a long expose on this one except to say that the old adage “garbage in=garbage out” is absolutely true. If you are not eating a halfway balanced diet you are setting yourself up for physical fatigue and many problems. Too much sugar, carbohydrates, caffeine, alcohol….well……you get the picture. Being solely 0.5 alerts and having no energy is like living within the fog. Balance out your diet and remember, “everything in moderation” is really the key here. I could go into greater details here but suffice it to say that if you can eliminate overloading the sugar and carbs your body will respond with a ton of energy. Try it and see. What have you got to lose? A couple of pounds and a ton of fatigue maybe?

I urge you to try a few of the 6 tips I suggest and I urge you to take this article seriously. Practice these tips just a little bit and before long you will discover that they will become habits. The benefits you will achieve by those habits will have everyone coming to you asking for the “secret” to your happiness! I guarantee that when people see how [happy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness) you are they will want it too!
