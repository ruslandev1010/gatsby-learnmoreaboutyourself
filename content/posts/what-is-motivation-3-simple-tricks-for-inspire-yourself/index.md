## How to inspire yourself: 3 simple tricks

### Create a positive atmosphere

Music can be as powerful a motivator as [inspirational](how-to-work-on-your-self-confidence) quotes. Every morning when you wake up, play some pump up songs before you start your day. You can listen to a playlist with inspirational songs on Spotify to help you move forward. By bringing your mind into the right mindset, you can move closer to encouraging yourself. When I want to go into this field, I hear “Time” written by Hans Zimmer, which has no lyrics but an intensity that helps me focus. If I feel like I’m interested, [motivational](https://www.oberlo.in/blog/motivational-quotes) songs like “You’re a Superstar” by Love Inc. pulls me in.

### Celebrate your little win

When you think about your big goal, you often start drowning. Because big goals are not achieved immediately. Instead, you need to create mini-goals along the way to help excite you. This way you can become more targeted and make a habit of being more effective. Celebrating your small win will help keep you motivated throughout your journey. Plus, the celebrations are always super fun. Maybe you break your goal into 10 small size tasks that get you on track to achieve it. For every 10 goals, you can add a small celebration. Maybe a sparkler dessert for one or a glass of champagne for another. Don't forget to check out some motivational quotes about success in the next section.

### Build yourself around inspired people

This returns to the point of a positive atmosphere: you need to be around other people who are as ambitious as you are. "You're the average of the five people who spend the most time with him," American entrepreneur John Rohan once said. And whether it’s true or not, the reality is around the right kind of people can only help you grow. If you are surrounded by people who love your ambition, you will become more ambitious and achieve more. If someone tells you that your goals are stupid and asks you to change them, you should avoid them. Stay around people who make you feel comfortable becoming an ambitious, go-getter so that you can become the successful person you want to be.
