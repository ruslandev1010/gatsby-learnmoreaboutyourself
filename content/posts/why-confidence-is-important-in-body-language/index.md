# Why Confidence Is Important In Body Language?

[Confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence) is needed in every aspect of our lives, yet many people try to find it. Unfortunately, this can be a vicious cycle: people who lack confidence are less likely to achieve the success which gives them more confidence.

For example, you might not want to back a project that makes someone obviously nervous, confused, or constantly apologizing. On the other side of the question, you speak clearly to someone who has raised their head, answered the questions convincingly, and will easily explain to you when they admit something they don’t know.

Their friends, their audience, their boss, their coworkers, and their customers.And gaining the confidence of others is one of the keys to success. In the following sections, we will see how you can do this.

## How to look more confident for others

You can show confidence in many ways: in your behavior, in your body language, and what you say and how you say it.

Presenting a positive image to others can help you improve your self-confidence. It’s not a matter of “making it”. If your project is with confidence, others will respond well, and this positive feedback will help you believe in yourself.

## Body language

Our article, body language, explores this subject in additional detail, however here are some general tips to offer you a more [confident look](best-ways-travel-can-improve-your-self-confidence) - and feel.

Adopt an open posture. Sit or stand up straight and place your hands by your sides. Avoid standing with your hands on your hips, as this can communicate a desire for dominance. And be sure not to slouch!

Keep your head straight and level. Do not lean too far forward or backward, as this will make you look aggressive. And if you’re presenting, use open-handed gestures. Spread your arms with your palms facing your audience slightly. This shows a desire to communicate and share ideas.

## Face-to-face conversation

People with low self-esteem often find it difficult to make a good impression, whether they meet a client, address a meeting, or give a presentation. You may be shy or unsure about yourself, but you can take immediate action to show yourself more confident.

It’s important to engage with people, so keep eye contact when you talk. This shows that you are interested in what they are saying and that you are actively participating in the conversation. Consider any cultural ideology when it comes to body language and communication.

Do not fidget or look away while the conversation is going on, as this may make you look distracted or restless.

If shaking hands is a common greeting in your workplace, be firm. Not too firm, though, and avoid being too far ahead. Reaching the other person's wrist or shoulder with your free hand is often seen as the simplest way to determine dominance, and isn't suggested for the primary meeting. Avoid creating the encounter awkward - or, worse, painful!
