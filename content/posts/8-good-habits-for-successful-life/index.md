Your habits build your future. Our Habits will be like our Habits make your Future.

Habits are not made in a day, they take time, so let&#39;s read Good Habits which will lead our life towards success.

## 8 Good Habits

### 1. Start Your Day Well Start Your Day with Positive Thought

Our whole day goes as we start our day. Read an inspirational book as soon as you wake up in the morning. Robin Sharma, author of Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, has written in his book that I call 30 minutes as soon as I wake up in the morning as &quot;Platinum 30&quot;. These 30 minutes decide your whole day, if you think only positive in these 30 minutes then your whole day will be very good.

### 2. Selfless Service

This is a very good way for yourself and keeps people around you happy. Since childhood, we have learned to do anything and get something in return. Now we change our thinking and work day by day, one thing is just for the happiness of instead, another, we need nothing. This will make the environment happy.

### 3. Be Your Own Time

We often say that I do not have time. From today, change this habit and start saying to myself I have a lot of time.

We have a shortage of time because we do not know how to manage time. Everyone in the world has only 24 hours.

Banda yourself that you will use your time properly. Do not let anyone waste your time. We will see that we waste a lot of time thinking about Facebook, Whatsapp, Gossip, Day Dreaming, old things.

### 4. Keep yourself calm

Anyone can get angry easily. But it takes effort to control anger. It is very important to know how angry, at what time, on whom to do it. &quot;This is not an easy task.

We are going home from the office. Then there is a lot of traffic on the road, someone put his car in the middle. We got very angry. By making anger like this, we made a habit of getting angry. Now the same habit makes us nervous. Now we have to reverse it. If you get angry, drink cold water, go from that place. Listen to an anthem. Remove your mind from that place and person.

### 5. Keep doing things that you like

Norman Cousins ​​has said - Maktu is not a sad event of life. It is sad to kill the desire to learn from within.

Do your interest work during the day. Give time to your hobby. Such as Dance, Swimming, Singing, etc.

Your life is becoming and worsening in your own hands, like a bundle formed by an ocean. By such a good habit, a person&#39;s character is formed.

### 6. Walk up Early in the Morning

We have all been listening since childhood to early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise

Most successful individuals wake up early in the morning because they have time to start their day according to their own.

Whether we take on Narendra Modi who wakes up at 4 am, Barack Obama, or Founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg all rise early in the morning.

Waking up early keeps our mind fresh, the morning keeps our health good, and we can plan our whole day well

But some people find it very difficult to get up early in the morning, Ignore small things to increase anything.

We will talk in our next post, How to get up early in the morning.

### 7. Never Procrastinate

The biggest difference between unsuccessful and successful people is that successful people do what they have to do at the same time. And unsuccessful people postpone it on tomorrow and tomorrow never comes. All positive thinkers also say that the habit of avoiding work increases negativity in us.

### 8. Forgive and forget

People have told us something or done something wrong with us, so we do not forgive them if it spoils our life itself. We always keep a wrong feeling in our heart for those people who only and only our It only spoils life. Until we do not forgive people, it is like that we are walking around with those people on our back, soon we will fall. Secondly, if we forgive, then we become very light. Somebody has said that if we forgive someone, then we are doing ourselves a favor and not on anyone else. They remember very old things. Purani should remember the things that do not make you happy. If you remember the old things that cause you trouble, then it is as if you have kept Puran garbage in your house which starts to stink in a few days. And we do not know how many old things remember old things, what will be the condition of our mind. This ends our goodwill, positivity, creativity, if you want your life to be good then first of all before sleeping at night and wake up in the morning and tell yourself that I forgive everyone. And let them go through their memories.

This habit will fill your life with new enthusiasm. It is said that forgiveness can only be done by those who are strong and take revenge for those who are weak.

## Your stuff put in the right place

This is a very small habit, but it changes a lot in life. If we keep all our belongings in the right place, then our mind also remains organized, it is believed that people who clean their bed as soon as they wake up in the morning are more positive and energetic, so the goods from where they are taken. Keep it in the same place and the ideas of the people whose goods are scattered are also scattered, they have difficulty in making decisions. The more you work with yourself, the more beautiful your life will be.

## Learn to say your point

Many people are successful in life because they are unable to say their words correctly. Either we do not say our words or we shout and say both are very bad habits. If you say your words while remaining calm, then you will be more successful in life. Saying your words is also an art which you can learn by giving your time.

## Don&#39;t be afraid of anything

We are afraid of change sometimes so that we stop our own path of success. Change is the law of life, learn to accept it. If you do not accept change then you cannot be as successful in life as you should be or as much as your power is. Keep your mind ready for everything new. Not every change is bad. To practice this, the restaurant in which you say that food should go to another place or do different work than the kind of work you like, which will make you go out of your comfort zone and become a habit of accepting change. Those who will be able to accept big changes in the future also. Because those who do not accept the change, either fail or are destroyed, this is the law of nature, this is what Darwin&#39;s theory says. Therefore, prepare yourself for change.
