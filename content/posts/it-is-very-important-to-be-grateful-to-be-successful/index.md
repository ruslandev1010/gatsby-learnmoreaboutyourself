# It is very important to be grateful to be successful.

We are taught by parents in our childhood that whenever we exchange something among ourselves, we should thank each other for it, that is, we should express our gratitude.

Nature has weighed the resources of every person. Nature has not discriminated against any person. But everyone feels that they are not given as much as the people around them. He is not so rich as his neighbors or friends.

Nature has made a person so beautiful physically, then he is financially weak and if a person is financially strong, then he is physically weak. Nature has definitely put some deficiency in every person somewhere or not. Nature has not made any person so complete that he has everything. This is why most people feel that they do not have what others have.

We are always advised by our elders to learn to express gratitude but we have never tried to know what scientific reasons can be behind expressing gratitude, why should we express gratitude?

The book The Science of Getting Rich, published in 1910, contains an important chapter on gratitude. The book is based on the Hindu ideology &quot;One for all and all for one&quot;.

The author of this book, Wallace Delois Wattles, wrote that to be rich you have to be grateful, whatever you have, you need to be grateful that you may not be rich but you can be physically happy. You are physically weak but strong financially.

Nature has definitely given some deficiency in every person. You do not need to pay attention to your shortcomings or weaknesses. You need to focus on your strengths. Enrich your thoughts and always feel that you have all the comforts you want. Pretend to be prosperous despite not having all the comforts.

If you are not thankful for what you have, then it is impossible to come to you. Why? Because the feelings and thoughts you transmit in a state of kindness are all negative. Feelings of jealousy, malice, dissatisfaction, or &quot;not enough&quot; can&#39;t get you what you want. They can only give you more things that you do not want. These negative emotions are preventing your desired things from reaching you. If you want a new car, but are not thankful for your current car, you are sending this strong frequency out. Thank you for what you have right now.

Always start your day by expressing thankfulness to nature and God while getting up every morning and laying on the ground, expressing gratitude that you are happy and thankful for what you have.

Gratitude is the surest way to succeed.
