# 25 Famous Introverts You Didn’t Know About

Commonly seen as this shy and socially awkward individual, there is more to an introvert than he or she is given credit for. In fact, famous introverts can actually be found anywhere and everywhere, from the arts to the political arena. They might end up devoting their entire lives to science, the study of technology or the pursuit of civil rights. What truly separates an introvert from the rest of the population is their need to have some time alone in between social appearances. They are extremely sensitive, though not necessarily moody. They are notoriously creative and idealistic and relentlessly determined to achieve what they had set themselves to achieve. They are dreamers and that is what ultimately makes them stand out in a crowd. It is therefore not surprising to find a few of them among your favorite celebrities or public figures. What might end up surprising you is really how all of these quiet personalities turned out to have such a big impact on us all.

Based on his personality alone, Elon Musk clearly fits the INTP type, as an intuitive thinker and an introvert perceiver. He's someone who takes more interest in his own inner world of thoughts and ideas than the external world of people and places. He isn’t a natural public speaker. He’s rather stiff while presenting ideas on stage and he never modulates his voice in order to better engage with the audiences. He speaks in a monotome, as if that’s the type of communication is more accustomed to. He always tries to listen without interrupting. His ongoing curiosity and thirst for knowledge would also be enough to peg him as an introvert.
