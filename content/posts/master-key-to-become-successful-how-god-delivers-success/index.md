# Master Key to Become Successful. How God Delivers Success?

![](./master-key-to-become-successful-how-god-delivers-success.png)

In my childhood, my parents taught me to pray to God on a daily basis, especially in the morning and evening. Likewise, the other children had many questions about God. Who is God and why do we need to worship Him on a daily basis? Why can&#39;t we see God? Does God Really Exist?

Finding answers to these questions was very challenging for me because I had so little to understand the things and activities of this world. Despite the disappointment, I continued my prayers to God. A few years later I realized that I had memorized so many mantras and chalices without making a deliberate effort to memorize them. It was at that point that I realized that I had memorized so many mantras that it was very shocking to me.

Now come to judge, when my parents forced me to chant in my childhood it was really a seed that every parent sows in a child&#39;s childhood. As I grew in faith in God, I experienced many miracles in my life. Miracles were related to my studies, with my family, my circumstances also supported me I was blessed with wisdom and I met friends who were very kind and helpful to me.

He has devised something special to level up your game of how faithful you are to God. In the beginning, it will be very soft for you and make your life run smoothly as most children in childhood are free from the obstacles of life, they just want their toys and friends. They just wanted to live every moment. But as we grow God throws out some challenges to level up your game so you can be more powerful than you.

Some people see these challenges as obstacles and try to get out of them but participate in the challenges as long as they get caught up in the cycle of problems. We need to accept challenges and difficulties. Difficulties have the power to create leaders.

## How Does God Hear Prayers?

We are children of God and God is our Father. He wants nothing but truth and mercy from us. God hears our prayers when we have no expectations from God. When our prayers are completely pure and expectations are free. We don&#39;t have to worry about our expectations because God is omnipotent and omnipotent. He has already planned something special for us.

## How to ask for guidance?

You will need someone to guide you whenever you are in trouble or unable to make a decision at that time. If you believe in God, you will remember God when you are confused. God is always ready to help His devotees and wants to see them happy. So what is the best way we can reach God and ask for help or guidance? It&#39;s so simple we just need to sit quietly and take five deep breaths, cool your mind, remember God and say to Him &quot;Oh my God, I know you are with me and watching me. I know you are omnipotent and omnipotent, you know everything about me and the things I go through. O God, I need your guidance to overcome these difficulties. Please show me the true way by which I can give them more power and success in life. Please help me &quot;

## How does God deliver success?

If a person is a believer, surely, he will have faith in God. There are many people who have faith in God but God gives success to very few people. The reason is that many people have a very unstable faith in God. Whenever God wants to bring His devotees to the level of the game, people curse God for the untimely difficulties in their lives. They just want to play the game safely and not cross the safe zone. God gives everyone equal opportunities but very few people embrace them and succeed in life and others are just busy complaining. God wants us to face challenges and become stronger. God always stands by the way we walk and helps us whenever we need help. No matter how big your problems are, always trust in God because God has planned something special for you.
