Once 2 friends went to a wedding. They were given a cold drink. The glass of cold drink was only half full. The first friend said that my glass is half empty. The other said, let&#39;s have fun with half a glass of cold drink.

Friends, this thing looks very small but tells us everything about our perspective. Our gaze is towards lack or good. If we continue to see the glass half empty, we will never be able to move forward in life. Whatever we get, we will remove the deficiency in it. It is evil with every good in the world. We have to make our lives ourselves. The first step for this is to &quot;see the good in everything&quot; See the Goodness of the Universe.

Initially, we will not see goodness. There is no need to worry.

Whenever a bad idea comes for someone, see that there will be some good or bad with many evils in it.

A bad watch also tells the correct time 2 times a day.

We all have the same problem when we watch a good video, we get positive thinking but in a short time negative thinking comes again.

We all know that if the water has to be raised, it takes a lot of hard work. The motor has to be installed. But when the water has to be brought down, turn the bucket upside down.

Similarly, when we want to teach our Mind something good or change our Old Thinking, the Mind does not accept it easily but when we do the same kind of work continuously, then the mind also gets to understand and that Change takes place.

It will take time to change the old thinking, but do not give up, keep trying.
